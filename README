Acer Aspire H340 Linux HDD LED Driver

First, I've really only tested this on a recent kernel, particularly 3.2.13.

If you try to compile it against your kernel and it doesn't work, let me know the version
and I'll make an effort to get it working for that kernel version as well.

The Makefile assumes you have a symlink in /lib/modules/<kernel version>/build that points
to the linux source for your particular version.  This is not a crazy assumption.  A lot of
distributions follow this pattern, but you can always change the makefile to point at your 
kernel source whereever it may be.

Just run 'make'
And then 'insmod ./h340.ko' as root
